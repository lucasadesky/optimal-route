## Wandrerer

A slightly convoluted adventure planning route generation script to maximize unique roads traversed in the minimum distance. Designed as a route planner to maximize path/road completion for Wandrer.earth, my urban running/biking obsession. Based on the Guan algorithm (Chinese postman algorithm) developed by Meigu Guan (Romanized to Mei-ko Kwan) using street data OpenStreetMap.

Allows polygon-based selection of a region on the map, then generates a path and exports a .gpx file of the route, which can be uploaded to most GPS trackers or smartphones.
